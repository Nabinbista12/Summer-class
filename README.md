## üìñ Short Description

TalentCrew is a project I built during my **Summer Class** at college üéì.  
The goal of this project was to create a platform where people can find talent based on **skills, college, or names**.  
Whether you‚Äôre looking to hire, collaborate, or just explore talent, TalentCrew makes it easier for users to discover the right people.

This project helped me **learn full-stack development**, including React, Node.js, MongoDB, and integrating third-party services like Cloudinary.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Local Development

To run the project locally:

```powershell
cd backend
npm install
npm run dev

cd ../frontend
npm install
npm run dev
````

**Notes:**

* Ensure MongoDB is running locally.
* Configure environment variables in `backend/.env`:
PORT=
MONGO_URL=
JWT_SECRET=
CLOUDINARY_CLOUD_NAME=
CLOUDINARY_API_KEY=
CLOUDINARY_API_SECRET=

* Frontend API is centralized in `frontend/src/config/URLAPI.ts`. Set `mode` to `'development'` or `'production'`.
* Backend API is centralized in `backend/config/URLAPI.js`. Set `mode` to `'development'` or `'production'`, or update the allowed CORS origin in `app.js` directly.
